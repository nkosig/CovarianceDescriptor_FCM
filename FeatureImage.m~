%  Description: This function calculates the feature image from the RGB image.
%               This function calculates the 9 features for each pixel in the 
%               image as described by equation 13

%  F(x,y) = [x y R(x,y) G(x,y) B(x,y) |dI/dx| |dI/dy| |d^2I/dx^2| |d^2I/dy^2|]
%
%  FeatureIM - Output feature image (W x H x d)
%  RGBimage - 3 dimensional RGB color image (W x H x 3)
